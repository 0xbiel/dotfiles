2021-03-02 12:41:46	@r2tg	<condret> @pancake i thought about the rsyscall thing. uhm maybe we can create a generalized rsyscall api, and some ducktape code which glues them with esil as esil-syscalls
2021-03-02 12:42:03	@r2tg	<condret> so esil stays independend from that api

2021-03-08 16:40:46	@r2tg	<condret> hmm, I also want to do r_io_map_location more efficiently but keeping track of gabs by size sounds hard somehow
2021-03-08 17:02:17	@r2tg	<Pehatius> Hey everyone,
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius>
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius> I'm a reverse engineering enthusiast willing to disassemble old DOS games (mostly in x86 16-bit mode). Currently I use IDA Pro 5.0 (which is officially free), but I want to move to opensource alternative. radare2 looks like a good variant, but I wonder does it contain the functionality I need. To be more precise, I need the following:
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius> - ability to disassemble DOS MZ files in TASM syntax (in order to recompile them with TASM)
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius> - ability to give names to memory addresses in order to use "mov [var_name], 50" instead of "mov [0x1234], 50" ("var_name db 0" in TASM syntax)
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius> - ability to define and use constants and enumerations in order to use "mov [0x1234], KEY_UP" instead of "mov [0x1234], 50" ("Enumerations" tab in IDA)
2021-03-08 17:02:18	@r2tg	<Pehatius> - ability to define and use C-like structs in order to use "mov [bp+MyStruct.MyField], 42" instead of "mov [bp+12], 42" ("Structures" tab in IDA)
2021-03-08 17:02:19	@r2tg	<Pehatius>
2021-03-08 17:02:19	@r2tg	<Pehatius> Is it possible to use right now? If not, what can I do to add this functionality into radare2/Cutter?
