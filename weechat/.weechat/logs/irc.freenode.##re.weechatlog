2021-03-08 16:28:58	Oxbiel	hey, I have a question, how useful are fuzzers when analyzing a bin? are they even needed or i would be able to find cool vulnerabilities without them?

2021-03-08 16:40:31	jn__	you can find bugs with fuzzers with other techniques, therefore you should give fuzzers a chance
2021-03-08 16:41:26	jn__	how useful? i don't know, but look at https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/#bugs
2021-03-08 16:43:28	Oxbiel	I'll take a look, thanks!
2021-03-08 16:44:49	jn__	note, if you want to use AFL, consider the successor, AFL++
