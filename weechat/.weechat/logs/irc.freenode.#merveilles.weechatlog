2021-02-06 19:32:39	--	You are now known as _0xbiel_
2021-02-06 19:33:11	rezmason	I have an estranged relationship with coffee
2021-02-06 19:34:23	rezmason	A shop nearby suggested I try a "low acid" blend, but aside from that, we're never a good combo. But I often feel like I'm missing out.
2021-02-06 19:34:37	neauoire	what do you mean never a good combo?
2021-02-06 19:34:41	neauoire	makes you feel anxious?
2021-02-06 19:35:21	rezmason	Hardly. No, it's a digestive... look, it doesn't stick around. It passes through me like water though a sieve
2021-02-06 19:35:41	rezmason	I don't get any sort of stomachache
2021-02-06 19:36:12	rezmason	but yeah, without being graphic, it's an easy come, easy go beverage
2021-02-06 19:37:21	rezmason	Which is a pain but also a shame! Do I have so few things in common with this worshipped drink, that it just bounces off of me? :D

2021-02-06 19:43:38	neauoire	that
2021-02-06 19:43:42	neauoire	that's unfortunate
2021-02-06 19:43:49	neauoire	it's a fun drug to get addicted to
2021-02-06 19:44:09	neauoire	you seem like a pretty energetic person without it anyways
2021-02-06 19:44:27	_0xbiel_	i've read some stuff saying that coffee can be laxative for some people
2021-02-06 19:58:02	rezmason	neauoire you might be right :D _0xbiel_ I'm sure you are
2021-02-06 20:00:48	@sigrid	if i don't have a morning coffee, i get migraine
2021-02-06 20:01:06	rezmason	Actually
2021-02-06 20:01:34	rezmason	flashback, I was the one who started the coffee machine for my mother, who depended on it to get through the day
2021-02-06 20:01:56	rezmason	We used the water to scoops ratio as its nickname, a seven-and-two
2021-02-06 20:02:04	rezmason	which became a seven-and-three and then a six-and-four
2021-02-06 20:03:37	rezmason	I dropped and broke the carafe once. You can imagine how that went over. Shit, what if this is psychosomatic? D:
2021-02-06 20:03:46	neauoire	haha could be
2021-02-06 20:09:19	rezmason	I took this someplace dark, my bad. Uh, modern life has plenty of coffee alternatives for when I'm truly in need of a stamina booster
2021-02-06 20:09:51	rezmason	But aside from the tea my wife sometimes makes me, they're all pedestrian compared to coffee
2021-02-06 20:33:47	dog_star	_0xbiel_: yup
2021-02-06 20:33:51	dog_star	as an ex-smoker too...
2021-02-06 20:34:04	dog_star	the combination of coffee and a cigarette in the morning jump starts the tubes like nothing else
2021-02-06 20:35:09	dog_star	i had quit it once but my brain slips so easily into 'crisis modes' that i ended up back on it. bleh. i wanna stop it because my anxiety is horrible.
